A repository that holds katas (codewar challenges). Completed close to 200 challenges and push it to this repository. 

## How it's made:
**Tech used:** JavaScript

Every single day I push a challenge to keep my problem solving skills sharp. 

## Optimizations

I'm always refactoring my code and optimizing for efficiency or just general readability. 

##Lessons Learned
There are some questions that sometimes can be difficult to answer so its ok to look at the solution to understand whats going on so that further down the line when a similar question comes along I know how to break it down and tackle it.
